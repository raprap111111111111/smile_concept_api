/**
 * Which branches a user is allowed to see.
 *
 * The codebase had no answer to this. `users.branch_id` and the `branch_user`
 * pivot both existed, nothing reconciled them, and every branch filter in the
 * app was an optional query parameter the caller supplied — so any holder of
 * `inventory.viewAny` could read, and edit, every branch's stock.
 *
 * The rules, in one place:
 *
 *  - `branch_user` is authoritative. It is the many-to-many set of branches a
 *    user actually works at.
 *  - `users.branch_id` is only a primary/default branch. It is the fallback for
 *    a user who has no pivot rows yet, and what a form pre-selects.
 *  - super-admin sees everything. Gate::before already grants them every
 *    ability, but abilities are not query scope, so it has to be stated here too.
 *  - A user with neither gets an empty result set, never an error. Seeing no
 *    stock is a correct answer for someone assigned to no branch.
